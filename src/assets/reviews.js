      'We traveled with 2 couples and 4 children, Joseph and his team took great care of us. From the start of the organization months ago, Joseph adapted to our requests and on site the team adapted to our 4 young toddlers. Everything was perfect: the organization, the hotels, the parks where we were able to see all the animals. We are delighted to have trusted calao and we highly recommend it!! We actually called on them again the following week in Diani for an excursion to the Wasani Islands!',

      'Thanks to Joseph for organizing this fantastic trip. From making contact and sending the quote, to the multiple adjustments for creating a tailor-made trip, Calao safari is launched with this French-speaking location to choose from. We traveled as two families with young children and Joseph was able to adapt to our constraints. We will recommend Calao to those around us for future trips. Thank you again for sharing your knowledge of Kenya with us. Big 5 as a bonus ;). Salam',

      'We had a good safari with breathtaking landscapes. We spent 2 nights in Tsavo East at Voi Safari Lodge. We were able to see animals although the time and vegetation were not ideal.Thanks to our guides Joseph and Pierre. Special mention to Pierre for his driving skills and his kindness and to Joseph for his joviality. We had a great stay, we will remember it!',

      "An exceptional French-speaking guide. 8 days of Safari between the reserves of Massai Mara, Lake Naivasha, Amboseli, Tsavo West and East. Joseph is a guide of rare professionalism, generous and dedicated. The lodges chosen are absolutely sumptuous in the middle of the savannah surrounded by Kenya's emblematic animals. The vehicle (4x4) is extremely comfortable, driven by an attentive driver who stops on request to take photos (more than 2000) and leaves to the sound of “Cest Bon! » In short, Joseph Katana Kombe took THE trip of my life!",
